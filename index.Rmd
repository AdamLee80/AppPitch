## The BMI Formula  

In the U.S. customary system the BMI is calculated with the following formula:  
$$\mbox{BMI} = \frac{\mbox{Mass}}{\mbox{Height}^2} \times 703$$
where Mass is the weight in lbs, and Height is in inches.  
The calculation can be implemented in R as follows:
```{r bmi_function}
bmi <- function(f,i,w){
            round(w / (f * 12 + i)^2 * 703,1)
      }
# test case: 5 feet 10 inches, 150 lbs
bmi(5,10,150)
```
